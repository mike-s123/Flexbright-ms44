  Click = quick (<0.2s) press  (on/off)
  Press = brief (0.2-1s) press (change to next mode)
  Long press = 1-2s press, light will fast blink (set brightness for this mode, when off switch sets)
  Extended = 2+ seconds, light will slow blink (start with this mode)
  
  Click turn on/off, starts with last saved setting. When on, Extended press saves 
    current mode as startup mode. Long press adjusts brightness 
    (hold horizontally, twist, click to set).
    
  There are two mode sets - constant (e.g. different
    brightness levels), and dynamic (e.g. different flashing patterns). To get into 
    the opposite set (constant vs. dynamic), Long press from off.
  
  Constant on set (high uses high current mode):
  Press to cycle through low, moon, medium, and high modes. Set brightness with long press.
   
  Dynamic set (these always use high current mode):
  Press to cycle through dazzle, blink (2 Hz), beacon 
    (0,1 Hz, blinks red tailcap LED 1 Hz), and variable* modes.
    
  *Variable mode gets bright when the flashlight is held horizontally, dim when vertical.
