  Press = brief (0.2-1s) press (change to next mode)

  Press cycles through levels/settings.
  Long press sets brightness in constant mode.

 Constant (different brightness levels), and 
 Dynamic (different flashing patterns).

  extended press while it's active (and on).
  
### Constant set
  Press to cycle through 3 low current levels (default: low, moon, medium) and high current mode.
  Set brightness with long press, then twist to set brightness. Click to confirm.

### Dynamic set (always use high current mode):
  Press to cycle through dazzle(random), blink (2 Hz), beacon
